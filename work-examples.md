<details>
Empathy.co needed a new, scalable documentation portal to replace a hard-to-maintain CMS with outdated, limited content. [Existing documentation](https://empathy.co/docs/) did not meet customer expectations: it was heavily technical, fragmented, and focused on an earlier version of the product.
  
**My Role & Impact**
- Co-defined the documentation portal design and development
- Led the **information architecture** and content model
- Defined and maintain **style guides, content standards, glossaries and documentation guidelines** to ensure a consistent voice and tone across the product
- Aligned documentation language and tone with **brand principles**, while adapting content to different audiences and use cases
- Authored approximately **75% of the documentation**
- Established a documentation system covering multiple content types:
  - Conceptual and feature overviews. See [Understand Empathy Platform](https://docs.empathy.co/understand-empathy-platform/)
  - Onboarding and integration guides. See [Onboard Empathy Platform](https://docs.empathy.co/onboard-empathy-platform/)
  - How-to and demo guides. See [Play with Empathy Platform](https://docs.empathy.co/play-with-empathy-platform/)
  - API and UI reference documentation and development guidelines for technical audiences. See [Develop with Empathy Platform](https://docs.empathy.co/develop-empathy-platform/)
- Authored and maintained additional **product communication materials**, including: content update timelines, content release notes and product changelogs, product roadmap–related documentation, and blog posts and FAQs.
- Collaborated on documentation for **internal open-source projects**, working closely with engineering teams to ensure clarity, accuracy, and maintainability.

The result was a **docs-as-code-based, centralized, scalable [documentation portal](docs.empathy.co)** aligned with the product’s evolution and the needs of different user profiles, from non-technical users to developers, integrators, and partners.

## Motive Documentation 
*[2023 – Present]*

### Selected Examples
- [**Motive Docs**](https://docs.motive.co/)

<details>
Motive’s documentation was initially owned by a different team and published in **Confluence**, making it significantly hard for customers to discover and access documentation. The structure and tooling were not aligned with how users searched for help or learned about the product.

**My Role & Impact**
When the project was transferred to my team, I led the migration of the documentation to our dedicated web-based documentation project, rethinking both structure and delivery:

- Led the migration from Confluence to a centralized documentation website
  - Reused and adapted the documentation infrastructure and UI components created for Empathy Platform Docs
  - Defined and prioritized portal features aligned with non-technical user characteristics   
- Oversaw the existing content conversion into Markdown, enabling a docs-as-code approach
- Defined the information architecture based on user needs, profiles, and usage patterns
- Collaborated with stakeholders to review, refine, and validate content for clarity and usability

The result was a documentation portal that was easier to discover, simpler to navigate, and better aligned with the expectations of non-technical SME customers. This project demonstrated how adapting documentation structure and tooling to the audience can significantly improve documentation discoverability and usability.

## Apisearch Documentation 
*[2024 – Present]*

### Selected examples
Due to the internal nature of this documentation, full guides are not publicly available. However, **censored excerpts and selected snippets** can be **shown upon request**, focusing on structure, clarity, and instructional approach rather than proprietary details.

<details>
After Apisearch was acquired by Empathy Holdings, the product had no existing documentation, neither internal nor public. In addition, the configuration dashboard's user experience was not self-explanatory enough to replace written documentation, creating friction for integrators during setup and configuration.

There was an immediate need to provide guidance to internal teams while a more comprehensive documentation strategy could be defined.

**My Role & Impact**
As a quick solution, I led the definition and creation of integration and configuration quick guides, focusing on enabling fast product setup:

- Defined the scope and structure of integration and configuration quick guides
- Oversaw and contributed to the authoring of documentation from scratch (initially written in Spanish)
- Published the documentation in Confluence as internal support documentation
- Reworked and adapted selected guides for an external audience

This approach provided immediate value to internal teams, reduced setup friction, and established a documentation baseline that could later evolve into a more complete public documentation offering.
