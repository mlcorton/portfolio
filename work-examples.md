  <summary><strong>Project Background</strong></summary>
  <br/>

  <p>Empathy.co needed a new, scalable documentation portal to replace a hard-to-maintain CMS with outdated, limited content. <a href="https://empathy.co/docs/">Existing documentation</a> did not meet customer expectations: it was heavily technical, fragmented, and focused on an earlier version of the product.</p>
  
  <p><strong>My Role & Impact</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Co-defined the documentation portal design and development</li>
      <li>Led the <strong>information architecture</strong> and content model</li>
      <li>Defined and maintain <strong>style guides, content standards, glossaries and documentation guidelines</strong> to ensure a consistent voice and tone across the product</li>
      <li>Aligned documentation language and tone with <strong>brand principles</strong>, while adapting content to different audiences and use cases</li>
      <li>Authored approximately <strong>75% of the documentation</strong></li>
      <li>Established a documentation system covering multiple content types:
        <ul>
          <li>Conceptual and feature overviews. See <a href="https://docs.empathy.co/understand-empathy-platform/">Understand Empathy Platform</a></li>
          <li>Onboarding and integration guides. See <a href="https://docs.empathy.co/onboard-empathy-platform/">Onboard Empathy Platform</a></li>
          <li>How-to and demo guides. See <a href="https://docs.empathy.co/play-with-empathy-platform/">Play with Empathy Platform</a></li>
          <li>API and UI reference documentation and development guidelines for technical audiences. See <a href="https://docs.empathy.co/develop-empathy-platform/">Develop Empathy Platform</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Authored and maintained additional <strong>product communication materials</strong>, including: content update timelines, content release notes and product changelogs, product roadmap–related documentation, and blog posts and FAQs.</li>
      <li>Collaborated on documentation for <strong>internal open-source projects</strong>, working closely with engineering teams to ensure clarity, accuracy, and maintainability</li>
    </ul>
  <p>The result was a <strong>docs-as-code-based, centralized, scalable <a href="https://docs.empathy.co">documentation portal</a></strong> aligned with the product’s evolution and the needs of different user profiles, from non-technical users to developers, integrators, and partners.</p>

# Motive Documentation 

- [**Motive Docs**](https://docs.motive.co/)

<details>
  <summary><strong>Project Background</strong></summary>
  <br/>
<p>Motive’s documentation was initially owned by a different team and published in <strong>Confluence</strong>, making it significantly hard for customers to discover and access documentation. The structure and tooling were not aligned with how users searched for help or learned about the product.</p>

<p><strong>My Role & Impact</strong></p>
<p>When the project was transferred to my team, I led the migration of the documentation to our dedicated web-based documentation project, rethinking both structure and delivery:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Led the migration from Confluence to a centralized documentation website</li>
      <ul>
        <li> Reused and adapted the documentation infrastructure and UI components created for Empathy Platform Docs</li>
        <li> Defined and prioritized portal features aligned with non-technical user characteristics</li>
      </ul>  
    <li>Oversaw the existing content conversion into Markdown, enabling a docs-as-code approach</li>
    <li>Defined the information architecture based on user needs, profiles, and usage patterns</li>
    <li>Collaborated with stakeholders to review, refine, and validate content for clarity and usability</li>
  </ul>
<p>The result was a documentation portal that was easier to discover, simpler to navigate, and better aligned with the expectations of non-technical SME customers. This project demonstrated how adapting documentation structure and tooling to the audience can significantly improve documentation discoverability and usability.</p>

# Apisearch Documentation 

Due to the internal nature of this documentation, full guides are not publicly available. However, **censored excerpts and selected snippets** can be **shown upon request**, focusing on structure, clarity, and instructional approach rather than proprietary details.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Project Background</strong></summary>
  <br/>
<p>After the acquisition of Apisearch, the product had no existing documentation, neither internal nor public. In addition, the configuration dashboard's user experience was not self-explanatory enough to replace written documentation, creating friction for integrators during setup and configuration. There was an immediate need to provide guidance to internal teams while a more comprehensive documentation strategy could be defined.</p>

<p><strong>My Role & Impact</strong></p>
<p>As a quick solution, I led the definition and creation of integration and configuration quick guides, focusing on enabling fast product setup:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Defined the scope and structure of integration and configuration quick guides</li>
    <li>Oversaw and contributed to the authoring of documentation from scratch (initially written in Spanish)</li>
    <li>Published the documentation in Confluence as internal support documentation</li>
    <li>Reworked and adapted selected guides for an external audience</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This approach provided immediate value to internal teams, reduced setup friction, and established a documentation baseline that could later evolve into a more complete public documentation offering.</p>
