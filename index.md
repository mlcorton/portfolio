# Luisa's Portfolio
I’m a **Senior Technical Writer** focused on product and developer-facing documentation for complex software products since 2009. I've worked across different organizational models—from family-run companies and start-ups to larger consulting firms—combining documentation strategy, information architecture, and hands-on writing, helping teams ship documentation that is clear, scalable, and easy to maintain.

I’m comfortable working in **distributed environments**, and I’m used to collaborating both within **dedicated engineering teams** and **cross-functional product teams**. Throughout my career, I’ve worked closely with designers, developers, product owners, product managers, and support teams to ensure documentation aligns with real product behavior and user needs.

A core part of my role is working directly with **subject matter experts (SMEs)** to deeply understand products and features, and then translating that knowledge into documentation tailored to different audiences—from non-technical users to developers, integrators, and partners. Depending on the context, I take ownership of authoring, reviewing, and maintaining content, always focusing on clarity, usability, and long-term maintainability.


## My Selected Work Examples

*2020 – Present* |

**Context & need**  
Empathy.co needed a new, scalable documentation portal to replace a hard-to-maintain CMS with limited and outdated content. [Existing documentation](https://empathy.co/docs/) did not meet customer expectations: it was heavily technical, fragmented, and focused on an earlier version of the product.

**My role & impact**
- Co-defined the documentation portal design and development
- Led the **information architecture** and content model
- Defined and maintain **style guides, content standards, glossaries and documentation guidelines** to ensure a consistent voice and tone across the product
- Aligned documentation language and tone with **brand principles**, while adapting content to different audiences and use cases
- Authored approximately **75% of the documentation**
- Established a documentation system covering multiple content types:
  - Conceptual and feature overviews. See [Understand Empathy Platform](https://docs.empathy.co/understand-empathy-platform/)
  - Onboarding and integration guides. See [Onboard Empathy Platform](https://docs.empathy.co/onboard-empathy-platform/)
  - How-to and demo guides. See [Play with Empathy Platform](https://docs.empathy.co/play-with-empathy-platform/)
  - API and UI reference documentation and development guidelines for technical audiences. See [Develop with Empathy Platform](https://docs.empathy.co/develop-empathy-platform/)
- Authored and maintained additional **product communication materials**, including: content update timelines, content release notes and product changelogs, product roadmap–related documentation, and blog posts and FAQs.
- Collaborated on documentation for **internal open-source projects**, working closely with engineering teams to ensure clarity, accuracy, and maintainability.

The result was a **docs-as-code-based, centralized, scalable [documentation portal](docs.empathy.co)** aligned with the product’s evolution and the needs of different user profiles, from non-technical users to developers, integrators, and partners.
