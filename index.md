# Luisa's Portfolio
I’m a **Senior Technical Writer** focused on product and developer-facing documentation for complex software products since 2009. I've worked across different organizational models—from family-run companies and start-ups to larger consulting firms—combining documentation strategy, information architecture, and hands-on writing, helping teams ship documentation that is clear, scalable, and easy to maintain.

I’m comfortable working in **distributed environments**, and I’m used to collaborating both within **dedicated engineering teams** and **cross-functional product teams**. Throughout my career, I’ve worked closely with designers, developers, product owners, product managers, and support teams to ensure documentation aligns with real product behavior and user needs.

A core part of my role is working directly with **subject matter experts (SMEs)** to deeply understand products and features, and then translating that knowledge into documentation tailored to different audiences—from non-technical users to developers, integrators, and partners. Depending on the context, I take ownership of authoring, reviewing, and maintaining content, always focusing on clarity, usability, and long-term maintainability.
